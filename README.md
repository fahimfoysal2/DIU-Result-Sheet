# DIU-Result-Sheet
I wanted to build a system that will get results and generates a total GPA list for the student of DIU

Basically this fetches result from the student portal of DIU. And arranges it in a noob way.
Nothing fancy.

Free to use update, distribute or anything you might like.
But if you do use the code, any portion of it, let me know.
All the data is owned by Daffodil International University.
So if the authority wants the project can go down anytime without any notice.
check the WIKI to usage.
